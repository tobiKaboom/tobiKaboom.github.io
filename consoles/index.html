    <h1>
        Consoles
    </h1>
    <span>
        My family has always been a Nintendoer. Being fairly young, the first home console I ever played with was, like many other people, the Wii. 
    </span>
    <h2>
        Wii
    </h2>
    <span>
        I very quickly fell in love with the Wii and the few games we had: Twilight Princess, Skylanders, Wii Play Motion... These are still, to this day, some of the games I love the most. 
    </span>
    <span>
        During the 2020 lockdown me, my brother and my dad homebrewed our Wii, which for some reason really scared me. 
    </span>
    <span>
        If you want to see more about Wii modding, head over <a href="/consoles/wii">here</a>. (As of right now the page is nonexistent, though!)
    </span>
    <h2>
        DS
    </h2>
    <span>
        The DS was the first console i ever hard modded. Nothing too difficult, just removing the charging port and adding an USB-C connector to charge it.
    </span>
    <span>
        It's a pretty iconic game console, yet not considered as much as it should. It makes sense, as the 3DS and the 3DS family is better in nearly every way and is fully compatible with DS games.
