	general info
    </h3>
    <span style="font-size: 18px">
	developer: valve
	year of release: 2007
	engine: source
	genre: platformer
	platform played on: ps3
	should you play it: yes!
    </span>
    <span>
	portal is an iconic platformer which has massively influenced media. 
	the whole game is based around you, a test subject for the company Aperture Science, who needs to make their way across test chambers using a gun that can shoot a blue and an orange portal, progressively learning specific ways of using then and the objects around you to exit the chamber.
    </span>
    <h2> thoughts </h2>
    <span>
	overall, the platforming challenges are fun, although a little frustrating at times.
	they are nearly always fairly intuitive: i only had to check a guide 2 times during the platformer part of the game (and that's impressive, seeing as i'm not very good at all at most video games).
    </span>
    <span>
	my only criticisms are:
	1) the performance: on the ps3, at least, every time more than one portal is rendered there is a massive lag spike;
	2) the last escape sequence along with the boss battle are a little dull, and definitely not as fast paced and exciting as the game would want to make you think.
	3) it's a little sad that the game has no more content after the bossfigh: although i don't like never ending games, a couple extra levels or just being able to replay any without having to start over would be nice.
