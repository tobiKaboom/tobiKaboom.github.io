	general info
    </h3>
    <span style="font-size: 18px">
	developer: dice
	year of release: 2009
	genre: platformer
	platform played on: ps3
	should you play it: yes!
    </span>
    <span>
	mirror's edge is a 3d platformer higly focused on movement and parkour in higly crammed and urban landscapes.
	the playtime is about 3-4 hours, but with a high replayability.
	it is structured in 11 levels: a tutorial, which somehow still has a lot of things to do, a prologue, and 9 chapters.
    </span>
    <h2> thoughts </h2>
    <span>
	 it is an amazing game
    </span>
    <span>
	my only criticisms are:
	1) the performance: on the ps3, at least, every time more than one portal is rendered there is a massive lag spike;
	2) the last escape sequence along with the boss battle are a little dull, and definitely not as fast paced and exciting as the game would want to make you think.
	3) it's a little sad that the game has no more content after the bossfigh: although i don't like never ending games, a couple extra levels or just being able to replay any without having to start over would be nice.
