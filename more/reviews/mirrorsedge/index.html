    <span style="font-size: 18px">
	developer: dice
	year of release: 2009
	genre: platformer
	platform played on: ps3
	should you play it: yes!
    </span>
    <span>
	mirror's edge is a 3d platformer higly focused on movement and parkour in higly crammed and urban landscapes.
	the playtime is about 3-4 hours, but with a high replayability.
	it is structured in 11 levels: a tutorial, which somehow still has a lot of things to do, a prologue, and 9 chapters.
    </span>
    <h2> thoughts </h2>
    <span>
	although it's a 2009 game, the graphics are astonishing: while the character models are nothing to write home about and the textures are not made to be looked at from too near, the overall environment and elements look beautiful and different from the games of the era: instead of the dirty and grey worlds of GTA V or Watchdogs, Mirror's Edge is built of white beautiful concrete and vibrant colors.    
    </span>
    <span>
	the gameplay is very fun and fast paced.
	there are some combat sections, which are still very fun but do break the rythm of the game: usually you can either choose to disarm your opponents (even using slow-mo to do it easier) or fighting them.
	the weapons have a semi-realistic weight / ease to handle mechanic which prevents parkouring which heavier guns and rifles.
