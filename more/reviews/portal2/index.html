	portal 2 - game review
    </h1>
    <h3>
	general info
    </h3>
    <span style="font-size: 18px">
	developer: valve
	year of release: 2011
	engine: source
	genre: puzzle platformer
	platform played on: ps3 and pc
	should you play it: yes!
    </span>
    <span>
	portal 2 is portal's sequel, set in the aperture laboratories after glados' death.
	it is a longer experience than the first game (around 12 hours, as opposed to the 3-5 for the original game), yet it does not feel dragged on and without any significant new content.
	the main addition to the platforming challenges are gels of different colors, which have different behaviours, air tunnels that push and pull you through them, and light bridges, which are solid bridges that can be extended through portals.
    </span>
    <h2>
	thoughts
    </h2>
    <span>
	portal 2 has, in my opinion, an art style much nicer than the first game.
	most of my problems with performace have also been fixed: portals do not lag the game nearly at all now and it generally runs much smoother.
    </span>
    <span>
	the puzzles are also more straightforward but still challenging enough to be fun, and the length of the game has been significantly increased: 8-10 hours (on your first playthrough) plus the coop mode and dlc.
	the story is really fun and both Wheatley's and GlaDOS's characters are really spot on.
    </span>
    <span>
	my only criticism remains the final bossfight: while it is certainly more fun and exciting that portal's, it could still be improved, as the pacing is definitely a bit slow and a repetitive.
