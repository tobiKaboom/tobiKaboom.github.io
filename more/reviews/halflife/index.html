	Half-Life is a revolutionary first person shooter released in 1998 by valve. 
	it uses a modified version of the quake engine, called GoldSrc, which was then used to make several other games, like Counter-Strike, Day of Defeat, Team Fortress Classic, as well as the Half-Life expansion packs. 
    </span>
    <span>
	it's an amazing game overall, with really few faults and it's absolutely a game you should play*
	the combat feels really nice, the weapon arsenal is really varied and in nearly every encounter you have multiple ways to kill your enemies.
	the graphics are obviously dated, yet the design is pretty uniform and some sections still hold up fairly well. this is where the asterisk (*) comes in: if you really can't stand the original game's graphics, maybe the original Half-Life is not for you. there is a fan remake, called Black Mesa, yet i still haven't played it so i don't know how good it is.
	there are a few simple puzzles, which are mostly fine, nothing much to say about them.
