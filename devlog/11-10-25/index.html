        Devlog #2: I'm confused
    </h1>
    <h2>
	11 October 2025
    </h2>
    <span>
	I have kept on doing some artwork and development on the game, but I've been having a lot of ideas and changed the direction of the game a bit, possibly, but since I've been having even more ideas I still don't know for sure
    </span>
    <h2>
	Art Style 2: Electric Boogaloo
    </h2>
    <span>
	Let's talk about the art direction. I kept on modeling and texturing, and I have improved a bit. I'm liking how it's going, although sometimes some models are a bit annoying to work with, as I'm still not the best with normal maps, roughness maps, etc.
	The art direction is pretty much the same as the original one, but I'd like to lean a bit more towards the slightly sci-fi-ness of Mirror's Edge Catalyst, without going all in on the LTT city.
