        Most people barely pay any attention to the keyboard they are using. They might have personal preferences, like higher or lower key travel, quieter or louder, or, if you are a gamer, even mechanical vs membrane keyboards.  
        I prefer high travel mechanical keyboards. The switches I use are mostly Akko Lavenders, but this is not what I want to get to. 
    </span>
    <span>
        I use what some people might refer to as "a horror mankind was never supposed to create", aka a 40% keyboard. 
    </span>
    <h2>
        40s
    </h2>
    <span>
        A 40% keyboard, which for convinience will now be called a 40, has some... quirky definitions. The 40s community has thus created the very memetic, yet extremely serious, 40s alignment chart. I consider myself an energy neutral and structure radical.

        That said, my first 40 was a Romeo bought from <a href="https://www.42keebs.eu">42keebs</a> which is, to this day, my daily driver. I used a split space and the 2 shift key configuration.

        I used it for about a year without any problems. But then I started getting bored of the layout: while it was perfectly functional and much better than my old 60%, I thought I could go smaller.
    </span>

    </div>
    <span>
        So I started researching and found a layout I liked: a split unibody ortholinear 40 called Lesovoz. The only problem was that it wasn't on sale anymore, and I couldn't find any on the used marked.
        I slightly changed the layout and started working on the keyboard's PCB, which I ended up calling <a href="https://github.com/tobiKaboom/deimos">Deimos</a>. It didn't go perfectly, though...

    </div>
    <span>
        I got the PCBs manufactured but... Well, It was not working. First of all, I forgot to add a 220 ohm resistor, which caused an LED to burn out. No big deal, I guess. But I also forgot to properly finish off some traces, so a whole row was not working.
    </span>
    <span>
        Some extra soldering later, and all was working. For some reason I had to switch out some columns in the KMK firmware but... whatever, it was fine.
        What was not fine, on the other hand, were the ergonomics. I quickly realized it was quite an uncomfortable keyboard. The way my wrists need to bend to properly use it reaks of carpal tunnel.

        So it sits on my desk, just looking pretty.
